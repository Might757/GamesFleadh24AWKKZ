# Patient Zero
You are John Doe, the first carrier of a deadly, mind-altering disease. Waking up in bed, you’re consumed by an uncontrollable urge to spread the infection throughout the city.
Driven by the virus instincts, you must infect as many people as possible to get the highest score. Fail to spread the disease, and you get killed.
Caught between the horror of what you’ve become and the relentless need to survive, the fate of the city—and your humanity—rests in your hands.

<sup> _Welcome to Patient Zero._ </sup>
